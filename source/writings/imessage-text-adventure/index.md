# Text Your Friends Interactive Twine Games with iMessage

### TLDR 

iMessage works as a great [Twine game](https://twinery.org/) interface because the reactions give the reader up six options to choose from. So long as you have each node of your story have less than six options, you can use [this python script](ADDLINKHERE) on a Mac to turn any Twine game into a fun adventure you can text to your friends!

The end result looks like this - the player chooses the appropriate to reaction to make their selection and get the next prompt

## Intro

I have made a little tradition for myself where each anniversary with my partner I gift her some sort of weird outsider art revolving around Boss Nass, the ruler of the Gungans from Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. There was once an inside joke in their somewhere, but it has been lost to the sands of time, and only this strange ritual remains as a vestige. Previous gifts have included commisioned portraits, my own poor renderings, and even a giant statue of him in her honor on [the oldest anarchy server in minecraft](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Front_Page).

(I should probably say here that she loves this and touts this one in particular as one of her favorite gifts she's ever received)

So this year for the Boss Nass gift of choice, I collaborated with a good friend of ours, [Rob Negrete](https://www.instagram.com/robthesentinel/) to create a dating sim where she has to woo Boss Nass and ask him to the Sadie Hawkin's dance in three days. He made me four great renderings of Boss Nass in various states of infatuation (seen below), and I went about devising a dating sim in Twine, and figuring out how to present it to her in a fun way!
