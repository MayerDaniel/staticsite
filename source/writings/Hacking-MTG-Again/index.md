# Hacking MTG: Arena to Never Lose... Again


### TLDR
Client-side validation strikes again, allowing infinite losses in the official tournaments hosted on MTG Arena. Without losses to deter progress, even a terrible player like me can trophy with a ~50% win rate.

Note the 6-out-of-2 allotted losses.

### How it works

I'll make this one brief. If you want to learn more about how I analyze the logic of the game and make mods for it, you can check out my previous two posts about cheats I've made below, where I go into more detail about the process:

I also have a tutorial about how to analyze and mod Unity games if you're looking for step-by-step instructions:
