# Magic: The Gathering Decks

[[Hive Mind]] [[Zedruu the Greathearted]] [[Thieves' Auction]]

One way I like to pass time is making decks for Magic: The Gathering and playing with friends. Above are some of the cards that I think make Magic the best game on earth due to how wacky they are. 

Cards can change the very rules of the game (and often do), leading to each match being different and a great deal of room for self-expression. Sometimes I feel compelled to write about what makes a certain deck fun to play and you can find those writeups here.
